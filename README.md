## Abstract
### The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  a  real  threat  to  the  survivalof  the  human  species  by  disabling  mobility,  education  and  economicalproductivity. This alarming situation has prompted the Artificial Intel-ligence community to think about using new tools in order to contributeto the fight against COVID-19. Computer vision is a sub-discipline of AIthat is blossoming since 2010s and helping in diverse fields like robotics,self-driving cars, health care by handling very complex non linear prob-lems. In the wake of this it’s contribution to the fight against COVID-19has to be taken into account. In fact only a few papers have been pub-lished recently in that regard despite the seriousness of the situation. Thisis what fueled our desire to make a contribution. This paper is intendedto  elaborate  very  powerful  and  robust  mask  detection  model  enablingthe detection of not only individuals wearing the recommended masksfrom those who don’t but the detection of a third category of people notwearing it appropriately is also taken into account by our model.

## Install all the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Open the taining_model.ipynb notebook to train your face mask detector with three classes -preferably use google colab for the training

## Run the Uni_face_model.ipynb for our uni faces model

## Run the Multi_faces.ipynb for our multi faces model

### Download the dataset containing 5302 images within three different classes Masked, not masked, mask not correctly worn.
### Download the yolov-face weights at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oj9p04mPjbbCbq1qSK8ChMjOhMLMpk42 and place them at the weights folder
